1) Adding movies with incorrect details about their quality will be punished by marking down the quality to zero so that they will appear right at the bottom of our database.
2) No multi-referencing. Do not add a movie or the same episode of a TV serial more than once on the same hoster.
3) Only movies with a correct imdb-id will be activated.
4) The correct movie title corresponds to the title given at imdb.com.
4a) Entries which have points or the year of publication in their title will be deleted (provided they're not part of the imbd-title).
4b) It is permitted to put additive information about the movie in the title (e.g. *uncut*, *special edition*, *director's cut* etc.) as long as they are marked with asterisks.
4c) Marking subtitles of a movie can be done by adding them to the title (marked with asterisks). So it's possible to add non-english movies as english ones by displaying this with the supplement *Subtitled*.
5) Movie2k is a streaming portal. That's why we are offering stream links and no download links. Links leading to downloads will be deleted.
6) Episodes of TV serials should be added with information about the according season and episode. The given title should be the title of the serial, not of the episode (titles of episodes can be added in the field of Details).
7) It is prohibited to enter links which are leading to homepages of competitors.
7a) Movies with opening credits promoting competitors (or such overlay) will be deleted as well.
8) Only official and full porn movies will be accepted. Film clips and incomplete movies are not allowed.
8a) NOT allowed are all porn divx movies and following hoster: Videobb, Videoweed, Novamov and so on.
8b) Every porn movie has to have a cover included.
8c) Every porn movie has to have a movie descripton included.
9) Uploaders, who submit "good" entries (according to the guidelines) are marked in our internal database, so they will be treated preferentially (their entries will be activated more quickly).

If you are flouting these regulations, it's possible that your user account such as all of your movie entries will be deleted. All questions will be responded via the m2k messaging system of our homepage. In exceptional cases answering your message could take up to two days. 
We are trying hard to activate the entries as fast as possible. However it may take up to 30 hours.

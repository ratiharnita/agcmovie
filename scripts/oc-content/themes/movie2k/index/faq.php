    <u>The movie does not working or keep showing "Connecting.." or "Buffering.."</u><br>
    This might be because the movie needs some time to buffer, you should wait some minutes patiently and then try to play, some hoster needs at least 2-3 minutes to buffer. If it still will not work, try to refresh the website.<br> 
    
    It is also possible the movie has been removed from the hosting website, then you should "REPORT AS OFFLINE". However, we try to delete all removed movies within 24 hours and add new working movies on <?php echo get_domain(get_bloginfo('url'));?></p>
  <p><br>
    <u>What are mirror links and what about the smileys</u><br>
    You may select another link on the left side of the website, if the actual selected movie does not work. Sometimes you have also different movie quality on other mirror links. The smileys show the quality of the movie version.</p>
  <p><br>
    <u>I found a movie with wrong smileys</u><br>
    As we are adding video files, sometimes the quality information provided is wrong. Please inform us by comments or use our report feature if the quality or smiley is wrong.</p>
  <p><br>
    <u>I found a broken movie or deleted movie on your site</u><br>
    Sometime video provider or hostings delete files because of copyright reports. Please click on "REPORT AS OFFLINE" so we are informed about this issue and the entry will be checked.</p>
  <p><br>
    <u>Is <?php echo get_domain(get_bloginfo('url'));?> a legal service</u><br>
    We do not host any files on our server nor we upload any movies on other hosting websites. We crawl many great search engines such as <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a>.<br>
    Our website works like a modern search engine, gathering and sorting movies from other websites and showing the embeded code or the direct link. So we are absolutely legal.
